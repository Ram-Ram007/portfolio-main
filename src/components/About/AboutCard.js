            When I'm not busy scribbling code, I like to keep things interesting
            by climbing mountains, gaming like there's no tomorrow, and scouring
            the earth for rare vinyls...You could say I'm a collector, but
            instead of stamps or coins, I collect grooves and scratches.

            drawn to technology and coding. So, I decided to embark on the
